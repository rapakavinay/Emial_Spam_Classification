Email Spam Classification Application


Overview

Welcome to the Email Spam Classification Application repository! This project utilizes machine learning to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails effectively. It features two main applications: a desktop application built with Tkinter and a web application built with Streamlit, both utilizing a pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model for real-time classification.

The goal of this repository is to provide an accessible way to demonstrate and deploy spam detection technology, as well as to invite collaboration on further enhancements.

Features

Machine Learning Model: Uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Desktop Application: A simple GUI application built with Tkinter for local usage.
Web Application: A Streamlit-based web interface that can be hosted and accessed remotely.
Speech Feedback: Integration with speech capabilities to audibly announce classification results.
